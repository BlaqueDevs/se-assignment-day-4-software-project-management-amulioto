## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?Comparison of Agile and Waterfall Methodologies
Approach: Agile follows an iterative and flexible approach, where development happens in short cycles (sprints). In contrast, Waterfall is sequential and structured, progressing step by step from requirement gathering to deployment.

Project Phases: Agile breaks the project into multiple iterations, allowing continuous development and testing. Waterfall follows a linear approach, moving through distinct phases—Requirements → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment—without revisiting previous stages.

Requirements: Agile is adaptive, meaning requirements can evolve throughout the project. Waterfall, however, requires fixed requirements from the start, making it less flexible to changes.
Flexibility: Agile is highly flexible, allowing changes at any stage, while Waterfall is rigid, making mid-project modifications difficult and costly.
Client Involvement: Agile encourages continuous client involvement with regular feedback in every sprint. Waterfall involves clients mainly in the beginning and at the end, reducing opportunities for mid-project adjustments.
Delivery: Agile delivers frequent, incremental releases, allowing early testing and user feedback. Waterfall provides a single final release, meaning users only see the complete product at the end.
Testing: In Agile, testing happens continuously within each iteration, ensuring quick bug fixes. In Waterfall, testing occurs after development, increasing the risk of discovering major issues late in the process.
Best Suited For: Agile works best for dynamic, evolving projects, such as startups or software applications needing frequent updates. Waterfall is ideal for well-defined, predictable projects, like government or healthcare systems, where strict documentation and compliance are required.
Conclusion
Agile is ideal for fast-changing projects that need flexibility and frequent feedback, while Waterfall suits projects with clear, unchanging requirements and detailed documentation needs. The choice depends on project complexity, requirements, and stakeholder expectations. Advantages and Disadvantages
Agile Methodology
 Advantages:

Adaptability to changing requirements
Faster time-to-market with continuous delivery
Encourages stakeholder involvement
Improves product quality through iterative testing
 Disadvantages:

Hard to estimate time & cost upfront
Requires strong team collaboration & discipline
Documentation may be minimal, making future maintenance harder
Not ideal for projects with strict regulatory requirements
Waterfall Methodology
 Advantages:

Clear structure with well-defined phases
Easier to estimate time, cost, and resources
Extensive documentation for future reference
Works well for projects with fixed requirements
Disadvantages:

Inflexible to changes once development starts
Late testing phase increases risk of discovering major issues late
Delays in feedback may lead to a final product that does not meet client needs
Not ideal for dynamic projects
Conclusion
Use Agile for innovative, evolving projects requiring flexibility and frequent updates (e.g., software startups, mobile apps).
Use Waterfall for well-defined, stable projects with strict compliance or documentation needs (e.g., government or healthcare systems).
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?When Agile is More Beneficial
Agile is best for dynamic, fast-changing projects where flexibility, continuous feedback, and incremental development are crucial. It suits projects requiring frequent updates and evolving user needs.
